# Crypto-Clustering

creating two financial analysis tools by using a single Jupyter notebook:

1. Read  the “crypto_market_data.csv” file from the Resources folder into a DataFrame, and use `index_col="coin_id"` to set the cryptocurrency name as the index. Review the DataFrame.

2. Generate the summary statistics, and use HvPlot to visualize your data to observe what your DataFrame contains.
